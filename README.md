# MPPT based simulation of PV fed Hybrid boost converter
 Simulation involves conversion of DC power from PV to generate simultaneous AC and DC outputs.

This paper proposed a hybrid converter topology
which can supply simultaneous dc and ac loads from a solar PV 
array. This topology is realized by replacing the controlled switch of 
single-switch boost converters with a voltage-source-inverter bridge 
network. The resulting hybrid converters require lesser number of 
switches to provide dc and ac outputs with an increased reliability, 
resulting from its inherentshoot-through protection in the inverter 
stage.
